        <h2> Fender Stratocaster</h2>
        The Strat was an immediate hit with professional musicians when Leo Fender introduced it in <br>
        1954. While other solid body electrics had already been introduced to the world, many people <br>
        would argue that none of them looked as cool as the Stratocaster. <br>
        <br>
        Leo Fender, alongside his trusted crew, realized they had hit upon a truly unique, world <br>
        changing design, simply by trying to “one-up” their competitor, Gibson. This attitude led to the <br>
        development of a distinctive image coupled with unique features that ultimately produced a <br>
        sound that could not be achieved with a Gibson. <br>

        <h2>Fender Telecaster</h2>
        The Telecaster has a single cutaway, which makes it easy to identify and separate from its <br>
        rock ‘n’ roll brethren. There are other distinctive features that make it unique for a Fender and <br>
        made it popular with Country guitarists. <br>
        <br>
        Instead of a Tremolo bridge, the Telecaster has what we call an “ashtray” bridge. This name <br>
        came about from the original metal covering over the bridge that players decided to remove <br>
        and use as an ashtray! <br>

        <h2>Gibson Les Paul</h2>
        Yes, the Les Paul is a signature model for the late, great guitarist Les Paul. This signature <br>
        instrument is one of the few models to ever have other famous players have signature <br>
        versions of their own. <br>
        <br>
        Ted McCarty, president of Gibson Guitar, tapped the famous guitarist Les Paul to help create <br>
        Gibson’s first mass-produced guitar. They wanted to create a higher-tiered expensive <br>
        instrument, and after a few prototypes they landed on a design that forever changed the <br>
        future of music. <br>
